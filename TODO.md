# TODO

- [x] Make it so `tag <bump>` in a repo with no tags just creates `0.1.0`
- [x] Inform the user when changing files and committing, pushing etc.
- [ ] `replacer.Replace` currently opens and closes the file on each run, if there are multiple entries for the same file, the file will be opened and closed multiple times
